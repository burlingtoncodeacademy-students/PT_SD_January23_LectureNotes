# The Terminal

The terminal is how we interact with our computer and it's directories(folders) and files.

It is a CLI: Command Line Interface, a text based interface to the computer.

We can type commands, manipulate files, execute programs, or open documents. More powerful and fast than a GUI.

(GUI is a Graphical User Interface using icons, menus, and windows for us to interact with in a visual way.)

### Other things to note:

- In the terminal a file path divides parent and child folder and files with a forward slash: /

- ex: desktop/PTSB_Jan_2023/Lecture/Unit_1/terminal.md

  - desktop
    - PTSB_Jan_2023
      - Lecture
        - Unit_1
          - terminal.md

- Using the tab key can help us finish a folder or file name we are typing out.

- We do need to type file/folder names exactly

- How to stop the terminal from running:

  - Use `ctrl+c` or `cmd+c` and enter/return
  - stops the terminal from running something and/or exits what's running/a menu, appears in the terminal as `^C`

- On Mac `sudo` may need to be used before commands where we need to elevate from user to admin privileges
  - a password field will appear and your user computer password needs to be entered
